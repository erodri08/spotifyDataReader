This is a program that collects spotify data from a file and creates a visual representation of that data. 

Spotify releases each user's streaming information at the end of every year, but I have always wished that I would be able to access my streaming information throughout the year, and view it in a way that is easy to comprehend and navigate. I decided to download my full streaming data from spotify's website and create this program so I can access my streaming data at any time. The source data from my spotify account is in the CPTspotifyData.csv file.
